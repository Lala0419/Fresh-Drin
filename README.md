## How It's Made:

This project was my first one using APIs. Created my own original image and logo to make it look unieque and fun! Also I added futures so users can have potions to choose from for various situations they might have.  



## Tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript



## Lessons Learned:

On this project, I learned the very basic about WebAPIs. The coneept of it and how and when to use it correctly. Find the right APIs that function and also to match with the project feature I wanted to add was hard at first. However it was a very good practice to get used to WebAPIs. Also I used a tool call [swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) and leanred so much of how to find and read the right codes, methods to use.
