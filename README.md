## How It's Made:

This was my very first project using APIs. Created my own original image and logo to make it look unieque and fun! Asked around to see what type of futures would be useful, and added them accordingly. More options for various situations that users might have.



## Tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript



## Lessons Learned:

On this project, I learned the very basic about WebAPIs. The coneept of it and how and when to use it correctly. Find the right APIs that function and also to match with the project feature I wanted to add was hard at first. However it was a very good practice to get used to WebAPIs. Also I used a tool call [swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) and leanred so much of how to find and read the right codes, methods to use.
